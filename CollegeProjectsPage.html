						<ul>
							<li class="project-titles">Countries - C++
									<ul>
										<li>This project was the first project of the semester, and if I remember correctly, was mostly to see where the class stood in terms of how well we can code. The task was to take two input files--one containing data on countries and the other with the continents the countries belong to--and organize each country to the continent it belongs to as well as keep track of which country/countries has the highest population, education GDP spent, and literacy rate based on gender for each continent. The country class only held setters and getters, and the continent class was the same plus the addition of an insertion operator (<<) overload. Most of the busy work is in the driver while reading the second file, where every country was assigned to their respected continent before said country was compared to the country with the highest population, country with the highest education GDP spent, etc. The result was in a high grade, but looking back on my code, could definitely been reduced. For example, while reading the first file, I would grab one line of data then check if it was missing, or N/A before grabbing the next line of country data. However, for each country, I could have read all the lines of data at once before checking.

							<li class="project-titles">Stack and Queues - C++
								<ul>
									<li>In order to learn the differences between queues, stacks, and their functions, we were to work individually and create a stack and queue using a doubly linked list. Provided source code, the task was to implement the linked list, and using inheritance, override the push and pop methods to implement the stack and queues. I started by implementing the linked list and the functions the stack and queues will be sharing. Next was the stack which overrides the push, and pop, and adds the top functions. The queue is similar to the stack where the only really difference is the pop function, and instead of top there is a front function. This resulted in a high grade, however, looking back on my code, I could have reduced redundant code. The push function was overridden in both the queue and stack class, but a second look shows that they are both the same implementation. The overloaded equals operator and the clear function are the exact same as well, so this could have been reduced to being implemented in the linked list parent class.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li><br>
							<li class="project-titles">TicTacToe - C++
								<ul>
									<li>This was a individual project where my class was continuing practicing linked lists. Given three classes, I was to take file(s) as a command line argument(s) that contained every board state in a game of tic-tac-toe, store each state in a linked list, and keep track of the results of the game, whether complete or not. I chose to implement a singly linked list. I started by creating the TicTacNode class, which will be the nodes for the linked list implementation in the TicTacToe class. Next, I read the file in the TicTacToe class, this way once all of the board states are in the linked list, the current pointer will be pointing at the last board state. Verifying the board state was as simple as see if one location on the board was equal to another in a three-in-a-row pattern. The TicTacTrie class was more difficult to implement as I had to view it as a tree where I am finding all the possible paths that could be taken using the game data from the files. The result was a project that I was proud of at the time, but after looking back on my old code, I noticed places that could be shortened or simplified.

							<li class="project-titles">Hash Tables - C++
								<ul>
									<li>While learning about hash tables, we had a project that would help us understand hash collisions. Given source code, we were to work individually and read in a file containing the state and coordinates of cities and hash them into primary table. If there was a collision in the primary table, we instead hash into the secondary table. If I remember correctly, I implemented the primary tableâ€™s insert function and getter functions before the file reader. Ignoring collisions for now, this was so I can see whether the data from the file was input into the primary table correctly. After this confirmation, I pretty much copied the primary to the secondary before going back to the primary and had any collisions redirected to the secondary table for hashing. In the end, a majority were hashed correctly, but there were still a few (to the best of my memory, it was about 20 out of 1000) collisions that were not resolved.

						<ul>
							<li class="project-titles">Workout App - Java
								<ul>
									<li>In my programming languages class, I was learning about how functional programming languages differ from objected-oriented programming. As a final project and given source code, I was to learn java in my own time and complete a workout application. I started by looking up java tutorials on YouTube, and looking over the documentation. As I was learning, I would notice the similarities between C++, and see how the syntax differs. As a result, I was able to implement a file reader, and the functions used to track the name of the person working out, the primary and secondary muscles that were being worked on, equipment used, and any descriptions and/or reminders. I also implemented the main window to the workout app that would connect to the other panels of the app.

						<ul>
							<li class="project-titles">Personal Website - html
								<ul>
									<li>The first project of the semester, making a personal website had the intention of getting the class to write about themselves, as well as a website that could prove to be useful in the future. For the website itself, I needed to choose what language to use and add an about me page, a portfolio page, a professional page, and a service page. I started off researching HTML through YouTube tutorials before researching CSS to stylize how I want my website to look like. By the end of the project, I was able to create basic content cards with a navigation bar, and create basic styling.

							<li class="project-titles">Tower Defense - C# in Unity
								<ul>
									<li>Our professor wanted us to think about accessibility rather than implementation for this project. That is why each group was allowed to choose whether to start from scratch, or use source code and add features that makes our game accessible. I would meet with my group about once a week and showcase what I had implemented, come up with what else we should implement, or help my other members brainstorm how to implement their assigned feature. I implemented a slider that adjust the RGB colors as well as a slider for color contrast for those who are colorblind. I even implemented the difficulty setting by adjusting enemies health and damage if more time to learn the game is needed. The result was a high grade for a tower defense game with features for cognitive, motor, visual, and audio impaired.

						<ul>
							<li class="project-titles">Search and Rescue - Ruby on Rails
								<ul>
									<li>I worked in a team with five other members where one of the professors in the computer science department was our client. Our task was to create an app for emergency responders that will show which areas on a map have been searched already during a natural disaster. I met up with my group weekly for scrum meetings, where I often would help the product owner define the value of the next tasks to take, and how to break the tasks up. Additionally, I implemented the entire database of images that allows emergency responders to save time from obtaining data during natural disasters. This would allow emergency responders to more easily find areas that have not been searched, or if there is anyone in need of help. The results of this project were admittedly subpar since it felt like only two of the six members contributed, however this was also when the covid pandemic started. This did however teach me the importance of communication in a team, which I carried with me into my senior year of college. I must also admit, I was a little proud figuring out how to obtain camera data such as orientation, angle, yaw, pitch, and roll from the provided images.
