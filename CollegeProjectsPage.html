						<p style="color: #ffab4a; font-size: 24px;"><strong>Data Structures and Algorithms</strong></p><br>
						<ul>
							<li class="project-titles">Countries - C++
									<ul>
										<li>We were to take two input files--one containing data on countries and the other with the continents the countries belong 
											to--and organize each country to the continent it belongs to as well as keep track of which country has the highest population, education 
											GDP spent, and literacy rate on each continent.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li><br>
							<li class="project-titles">Stack and Queues - C++
								<ul>
									<li> A project used to understand how queues, stacks, and their functions work. We made a stack and queue with the use of a singly linked list.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li><br>
							<li class="project-titles">TicTacToe - C++
								<ul>
									<li>The TicTacToe class read in a file with every move made in the game, and made a linked list (either doubly or singly linked) with each node being each move, and determines 
										who won, lost, if there was a draw, or if the game is unfinished. The TicTacTrie class was used to keep track on how many times each player 
										won, or how many draws there were.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li><br>
							<li class="project-titles">2-3 Tree - C++
								<ul>
									<li>I would rather forget this project, so to put it simply, we were to construct a 2-3 tree and use a tree iterator to find the first item, last 
										item, and range in the tree equal to a given key.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li><br>
							<li class="project-titles">Hash Tables - C++
								<ul>
									<li>Reading in a file with cities, the idea of the project was to hash the cities into a primary table, and if the hash would have resulted in a 
										collision, we instead hash into the secondary table.
									</li>
								</ul>

						<p style="color: #ffab4a; font-size: 24px;"><strong>Programming Languages</strong></p><br>
						<ul>
							<li class="project-titles">Workout App - Java
								<ul>
									<li>given source code, we were to make a workout app in java. We implemented the file reader and the functions used to track the name of the person 
										working out, the primary and secondary muscle, equipment used, and any descriptions and reminders. We also implemented a main window with buttons 
										leading to panels pertaining to workouts for that specific muscle group, but not the panels themselves.
									</li>

						<p style="color: #ffab4a; font-size: 24px;"><strong>Programming Studio</strong></p><br>
						<ul>
							<li class="project-titles">Personal Website - html
								<ul>
									<li>We were to go and learn any language of our choice to create a website on our own and have a home page, about me page, professional page, portfolio 
										page, and a service page. The professional page had our resume, the portfolio page had our past projects (only descriptions if they were class projects), 
										and the service page had anything prominent we did in the past.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li><br>
							<li class="project-titles">Tower Defense - C#
								<ul>
									<li>Either starting from scratch, or finding open source code and adding on, we were to make a game of our choice that added functionality that made it easier 
										for people with disabilities to play the game. My group chose to add on to open source code as well as make a tower defense game. We added the options to play 
										the game with either mouse or keyboard, added the options to change the contrast, text color, font size, keybinds, voice overs, and more.
									</li>
								</ul>

						<p style="color: #ffab4a; font-size: 24px;"><strong>Software Engineering</strong></p><br>
						<ul>
							<li class="project-titles">Search and Rescue - Ruby on Rails
								<ul>
									<li>Given our clients needs and wants for the project, we were to make an application for emergency responder's that would upload images taken by a drone 
										with metadata and put a marker on a map to indicate where that image was taken. We also were to put an arrow on the map indicating which direction the camera 
										was facing, as well as a shaded area that indicated what was covered by the image. To make the emergency responder's jobs easier, we were to have a navigation 
										bar at the top that has a slider that would narrow down the markers to a specific date range, and toggle switches that would turn the arrows or the shaded areas 
										off.
